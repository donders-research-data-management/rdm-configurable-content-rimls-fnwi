A new collection in the Donders Repository has been created for which you are the manager. This means that you are responsible for its content and access.

DI colleagues may be added as viewer, contributor or (co-)manager. 
See here <a href="http://www.ru.nl/donders/research/data/user-manual/get-started/edit-your-collection-details/">how to add other users</a>.
