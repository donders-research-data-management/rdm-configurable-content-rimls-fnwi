<h1 class="page-header">Welcome to the RIMLS-FNWI Repository</h1>

<p>The departments of Molecular Biology and Molecular Developmental Biologyare part of the Faculty of Science (FNWI) of the Radboud University and affiliated with and housed at the Radboud Institute for Molecular Life Sciences (RIMLS). The RIMLS-FNWI has a strong interest in (developmental) gene regulation, with a particular emphasis on (epi)genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and bioinformatics in the context of pluripotency, cell lineage commitment and disease (e.g. cancer and malaria).</p>

<p>This repository is currently in the pilot phase.</p>
