<h1 class="page-header">Welcome to the RIMLS-FNWI Repository</h1>

<p>The departments of Molecular Biology and Molecular Developmental Biology are part of the Faculty of Science of the Radboud University. We are affiliated with and housed at the Radboud Institute for Molecular Life Sciences (RIMLS), which is a joint research institute of the Radboud University Medical Centre and Faculty of Science (Radboud University).</p>

<p>Both departments have a strong interest in (developmental) gene regulation, with a particular emphasis on (epi)genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and bioinformatics in the context of pluripotency, cell lineage commitment and disease (e.g. cancer and malaria). The departments have their own state-of-the-art sequencing and proteomics facilities as well as a specialized bioinformatics team for in depth data analysis. The departments are very internationally oriented, with several nationalities represented in the departments, and there is extensive collaboration and networking with international partners, often in projects funded by the EC and/or NIH.</p>

<p>This repository is being used by RIMLS-FNWI researchers to manage their research data, organized in work-in-progress and finalized data acquisition collections, research documentation collections, and data sharing collections. Everyone can request access to the data sharing collections.</p>
